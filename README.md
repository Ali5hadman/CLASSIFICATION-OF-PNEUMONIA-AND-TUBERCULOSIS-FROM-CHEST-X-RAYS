# CLASSIFICATION-OF-PNEUMONIA-AND-TUBERCULOSIS-FROM-CHEST-X-RAYS
The project utilized Deep Learning techniques to detect pneumonia and tuberculosis in chest X-rays.

The project utilized Deep Learning techniques to detect pneumonia and tuberculosis in chest X-rays. The dataset was analyzed, and noise-contaminated images were enhanced using median filter and Gaussian noise. Three models, KNN, homemade CNN, and VGG were trained for image classification. Lime explainability was used to compare models with different fine-tuned layers, highlighting the importance of accurate feature extraction. Ensemble methods were applied to average the models, resulting in a slight improvement.
